ANN Categorical Handling and Hyperparameter Tuning
This repository explores using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in machine learning, focusing on handling categorical data and demonstrating various techniques to convert categorical values into numerical formats for model compatibility. Additionally, it includes experiments with hyperparameter tuning for optimizing model performance.

Project Overview
In this project, I experimented with:

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): Implemented and tuned an ANN model for a predictive task.
Handling Categorical Data: Investigated methods to transform categorical features into numerical values suitable for ANN models.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimented with hyperparameter optimization to enhance model performance.
Key Techniques for Handling Categorical Data
When working with categorical features, choosing the correct transformation technique can significantly impact model accuracy. Here, I explored:

One-Hot Encoding: Transforms categorical values into binary columns, making data suitable for machine learning models but can increase dimensionality.
Label Encoding: Converts categories to numeric labels. This technique is simple and effective but may introduce unintended ordinal relationships.
Target Encoding: Replaces categories with their mean target values, reducing dimensions without losing critical information.
Binary Encoding: Combines the best of both one-hot and label encoding by reducing high cardinality in categorical data.
Each of these methods has distinct applications based on the dataset characteristics and the machine learning model in use.

Hyperparameter Tuning
I implemented hyperparameter tuning for the ANN model to achieve the best results. Key hyperparameters tested include:

Learning Rate: Controls the step size in the gradient descent optimization.
Batch Size: Determines the number of samples per gradient update, impacting convergence speed.
Number of Layers and Neurons: Experimented with different network architectures to optimize performance.

Conclusion
This project provides a foundational approach to handling categorical data with ANN and demonstrates how hyperparameter tuning can significantly improve performance. It serves as a practical guide for using ANN in real-world applications involving categorical features.
